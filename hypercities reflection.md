### HyperCities: Thick Mapping in the Digital Humanities Reflection

Humanists have found ways to broadcast the voices of the people, whether through twitter or other hosting websites. People are supporting others who are having their freedoms at risk. Misinformation is an issue faced by all sides in social media, being able to decipher what is true is important for movements to be effective. An issue teams, like Hypercities, face is the number of people reporting. For example, only 5% of people in Egypt used social media during the revolution. Growing the network of people on social media would give others more information and more stories. They have many context to data issues, like defining when events “end”. Tricky problems like this mean exhaustive definitions to make sure the information relayed is correct and interpreted as intended. 

I sometimes neglect to think about how protestors must evade authority seeing their social media posts. If a government lacked democracy, posts could lead authorities to track and reprimand protestors. This is an example of the people wanting their voice be heard and the oppressor trying to silence them. In Iran, westerners tried aiding the distribution of information during protests. They tried to give time sensitive information for the movements to have some amount of coordination. In America, movements are able to organize and spread their message a lot easier, this isn’t the case in other countries. I realized that even things like slogans were unifying for the protestors. There is importance in creating and mapping the timeline of events for the movement in Iran, it enables a history and story to tell. 




**Question 1:** How are they able to make sure their contacts in the countries they are trying to assist are credible?

**Question 2:** How are the sources confident/how do we make them more confident in willing to leak the information they aim to broadcast.
