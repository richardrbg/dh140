### Richard Garcia


My name is Richard Garcia. I am a fourth year statistics major interested in learning python and its applications. I have experience in R statistical programming, machine learning, and market research. 

This repository is to display my projects and work done for **DH 140**. It is my first time using Github seriously!


**DH 140** considers how to apply coding to research in humanities and social sciences, and project-based learning. Students discover how to manage and display data with added impact. Content and goals are guided by freedom to research more effectively and freedom of speech.
