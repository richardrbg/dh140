## Response to Rachel Levine on using Open Street Maps for humanitarian causes

#### Digital Humanities 140: Week 3 
#### Richard Garcia
Open data allows for people of different backgrounds to easily access and participate in humanitarian causes. Like we see everywhere in society, having people with diverse perspectives, skill sets, and experiences allows for more creativity and innovation to occur in this sector. I liked how field mapping really relies on collaboration and coordination of mutliple groups and people to have the network of data collected. It proved the importance of uses vast resources. I noticed how often nuances in the data led to very powerful and important insights. For example, using facebook meta data to realize high activity versus lack of activity after a storm in a geographic region because of lost connection/power. I believe using open data will allow my partner and I to use and create more objective metrics that balance our research and contextual knowledge we know that pertains to our target questions. Without open data, we would be at a severe disadvantage because our research will require a balance of mixed method approaches.
