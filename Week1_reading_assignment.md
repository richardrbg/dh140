**Summary:**
Logistic regression is useful for assignment to one of two assignment groups (categorical) dependent on an assortment of discrete and continuous variables. This is very useful for research in humanities and social sciences. It differs from linear regression because the outcome is a category rather than a numerical value. The values are fit to a sigmoid function(S-like shape) rather than a line. Each tail of the S acts as a category, and the closer an observation is to the end of the tail( with respect to the x -axis), the higher probability an observation is assigned to that group. There is a decision boundary where the cutoff to assignment of a group is. This requires context to the data and situation. For example, if I wanted to assign individuals high income vs non-high income, I could say the top 25% of income earners are high income.  Logistic regression can be built upon for more than two assignment groups(multinomial regression) and ordering of multiple group assignment(ordinal regression) 

**Reflection:** 
I picked this article because I know working with lots of data complements coding and machine learning. Logistic regression is a good fundamental method, and it is able to deal with qualitative and quantitative data which makes it very useful for social science research. For example, if I worked with Uber data, I could categorize different regions of a city as high, medium, or low traffic congestion based on a variety of variables. This could be visualized over a map that is colored to represent the groups. I now am more familiar with a method of data manipulation that could be viable for my future work in this class.
